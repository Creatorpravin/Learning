# **DHCP Server**
 * A DHCP Server is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways and other network parameters to client devices. 
  * A DHCP server automatically sends the required network parameters for clients to properly communicate on the network. 
  * Without it, the network administrator has to manually set up every client that joins the network, which can be cumbersome, especially in large networks.
  * DHCP servers usually assign each client with a unique dynamic IP address, which changes when the clientâ€™s lease for that IP address has expired.
