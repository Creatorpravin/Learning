# Gateway

 * A gateway is a network node that forms a passage between two networks operating with different transmission protocols. 
 * The most common type of gateways, the network gateway operates at layer 3, i.e. network layer of the OSI (open systems interconnection) model. However, depending upon the functionality, a gateway can operate at any of the seven layers of OSI model. 
* It acts as the entry â€“ exit point for a network since all traffic that flows across the networks should pass through the gateway. Only the internal traffic between the nodes of a LAN does not pass through the gateway.
