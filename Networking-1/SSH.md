# SSH

*Secured Shell or Secured Socket Shell*

* **ssh** (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
     for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to pro‚Äê
     vide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
     over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and
     UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

* **ssh** connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be
     specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form
     ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove his/her identity
     to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).


* The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.

* It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption.
