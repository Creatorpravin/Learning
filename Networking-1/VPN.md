# VPN

 * **A virtual private network,** or VPN, is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network.

 * It prevents unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic and allows the user to conduct work remotely.

  * A VPN extends a corporate network through encrypted connections made over the Internet. Because the traffic is encrypted between the device and the network, traffic remains private as it travels. An employee can work outside the office and still securely connect to the corporate network. Even smartphones and tablets can connect through a VPN.

 * Yes, traffic on the virtual network is sent securely by establishing an encrypted connection across the Internet known as a tunnel. VPN traffic from a device such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone is encrypted as it travels through this tunnel. Offsite employees can then use the virtual network to access the corporate network.
