# DNS Resolver

* A DNS resolver, also called a recursive resolver, is a server designed to receive DNS queries from web browsers and other applications. The resolver receives a hostname - for example, www.example.com - and is responsible for tracking down the IP address for that hostname.

 * The DNS resolver might be operated by the local network, an Internet Service Provider (IP), a mobile carrier, a WIFI network, or other third party. The resolver starts by looking in its local cache or that of the operating system on the local device - if the hostname is found, it is resolved immediately.
