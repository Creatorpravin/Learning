# **Chapter 1**
* Presentation Format
   - JavaScript Grammar is not a complete JavaScript reference or manual. The subjects were reduced to only what’s important in modern-day JavaScript environment.
   - Namely: imports, classes, constructors, key principles behind functional programming, including many features ranging from ES5 - ES10 are covered in this book.
* Creative Communication:
   - Some of JavaScript is easy, some of it is difficult. Not everything can be explained by source code alone. Some things are based on intangible ideas or principles. 
   - Throughout this tutorial book you will come across many creative communication devices, designed to make the learning process a bit easier and perhaps more fun. One example of that is color-coded diagrams.
* Theory:
   - Not all subjects require extensive theory. On the other hand, some things won’t make any sense without it.  
   - Additional discussion will be included, where it becomes absolutely necessary, in order to fully understand a particular concept.
* Color-Coded Diagrams:
       - A significant amount of effort went into creating diagrams describing fundamental ideas behind JavaScript.
       - They were designed for communicative value, hopefully  they will speed up the learning process in places where hard to grasp abstract ideas need to be explained visually.
       

* Source code:
 - Source code listings will be provided to cement the foundational principles from preceding text.  

**Example:**  
 ```css
  // Create (instantiate) a sparrow from class Bird  
  let sparrow = new Bird(“sparrow”,”gray”);  
  sparrow.fly();  
  sparrow.walk();  
  sparrow.lay_egg();  
  sparrow.talk();  //error,only parrot can talk  
 ```
 
 - This is an example of instantiating sparrow object from Bird class and using some of its methods.
* Code close ins:
     - Most of the source code is accompanied by source code listings. 
     - But when we need to close in on a particular important subject, a slightly larger diagram with source code and additional color-coded highlighting will be shown. 
For example, here is exploration of an anonymous function when used in the context of a event callback function:

    ```
    setTimeout(function() {    
    console.log(“print  something  in  1 second”);
    }, 1000);


# **Chapter 2**
**Chrome Console**
* 2.0.1 Beyond Console Log
   - Many programmers only know Chrome’s console.log but the console API contains few other methods that have practical use, especially when time is of essence.
* copy(obj) function
Copying JSON representation of an existing object to your copy buffer:
```javascript
let x = {property: 1, prop1: 2, method: function(){}};
copy(x);

```
 - Now the JSON is in your copy-paste buffer, you can paste it into any text editor.
 - In this example x is a simple self-created object. But imagine a situation where a
much more complex object is returned from a database API.
- **Note:** Only JSON is returned, this means that methods will not make it to the
copy buffer. (JSON string format does not support methods, only properties.)


**2.0.2 console.dir**
 - If you want to take a look at all object’s properties and methods, you can print it
out directly into the console using console.dir method:

```javascript
console.dir(x)
VM129:1 Objectmethod: ƒ ()prop1: 2property: 1[[Prototype]]: Object
```
 - Note: In simple words, the console.log() returns the object in its string representation and console.dir() recognizes the object just as an object and outputs its properties. Both log() and dir() returns the string just as a string.

 - Get the output of **DOM Element**
```javascript
console.dir(document.body)
```

* 2.0.3 console.error
```javascript
let fuel = 99;
function launch_rocket(){
    function warning_mgs(){
        console.error("Not enough fuel.");  
    }

if(fuel >= 100)
{
    //looks everything is fine
 }
  else
        warning_mgs(); 
}
launch_rocket();
```
The great thing about console.error is that it also provides the stack trace:
```
VM1971:4 Not enough fuel.
warning_mgs	@	VM1971:4
launch_rocket	@	VM1971:13
(anonymous)	@	VM1971:16
```
