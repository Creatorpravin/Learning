* How do u code in python
* Suite 
  - A group of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in Python. Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.
  - Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon (: ) and are followed by one or more lines which make up the suite. 
* Data types 
  - Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
* Different ways to concatenate tuple
  -  Using [+] operator
  -  Using sum()
  -  Using list() and extend()
* Slice operator
  - The slice() function returns a slice object.A slice object is used to specify how to slice a sequence. You can specify where to start the slicing, and where to end. You can also specify the step, which allows you to e.g. slice only every other item.
  - syntax => slice(start, end, step)
* Different functions in python.
  - Python Built-in Functions.
  - Python Recursion Functions.
  - Python Lambda Functions.
  - Python User-defined Functions.
* Create a class with parameters and Create a method that prints those parameters and an object to call that method
* Use of pass
  - The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
